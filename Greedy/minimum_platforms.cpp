Run two nested loops the outer loop from start to end and the inner loop from i+1 to end.

Update the answer with the maximum count of overlap in each iteration of the outer loop.

Algorithm:

1.Sort the arrival and departure times of trains.
2.Create two pointers i=0, and j=0 and a variable to store ans and current count plat
3.Run a loop while i<n and j<n and compare the ith element of arrival array and jth element of departure array.
4.If the arrival time is less than or equal to departure then one more platform is needed so increase the count, i.e. plat++ and increment i
5.Else if the arrival time greater than departure then one less platform is needed so decrease the count, i.e. platâ€“ and increment j
6.Update the ans, i.e ans = max(ans, plat).

/*
Method 3: If all the arrival and departure occur on the same day 
then we can use and auxiliary array to compute the required number of the platform in O(n).
Whenever an arrival occurs we increase the count of the required platform 
when a departure occurs we decrease the required platform at that point of time, after that, 
we take the cumulative sum, which would provide the required number of platform for all point of time, 
out of these values maximum value is our answer.
